Given a set of time intervals in any order, merge all overlapping intervals into one and output the result which should have only mutually exclusive intervals. Let the intervals be represented as pairs of integers for simplicity.
For example, let the given set of intervals be [25,30] [2,19] [14,23] [4,8]. Here the intervals are overlapping, so the final output of the code will be [2,23] [25,30].
